I feel you can have a really positive impact on the other players, on and off the field. I can’t guarantee selection but we want you to fulfil that role for us this winter.’”

With that, Chris Woakes was folding up his England whites and popping them in the suitcase for the first time in two and a half years. Destination? Multan, for the three-Test series against Pakistan that begins on Monday. The mission? A series win, naturally. But, on a personal level, a correction to the numbers and narrative that make this return to life on the road a very Brendon McCullum selection. At home, the figures are stellar and worth repeating. Fresh from 24 wickets at 20.25 in a 5-1 Test summer, Woakes has 137 at 21.59 on home soil. It is the lowest bowling average for any seamer in England with 100-plus victims, bar Fred Trueman and Alec Bedser. The strike rate – a wicket every 42.9 balls – is bettered by no one. Throw in the runs from No 8, the professionalism, plus the small matter of two World Cup winner’s medals, and McCullum, always sunny side up admittedly, wasn’t hyperbolising when hailing a “remarkable cricketer” during the season.

But chatting over a flat white in Birmingham last week before flying to Pakistan, Woakes, acknowledged the flip side; those 36 wickets at 51 on the road that have kept the chatterati going over the course of his 11-year Test career. He is not immune to the eyebrows raised at this overseas recall, the jokes about confiscating his passport, nor is he consumed by them either. The backing of his head coach and his captain, Ben Stokes, is plenty.

“I’ve been around long enough, I know I need to be better [away from home],” he says, meeting the subject head on. “The slight frustration from my side would be that, yes, I agree, my away record is nowhere near as good as at home. But my home record is bloody good. Exceptional. So it’s pretty hard to get the two exactly the same.

“It’s more when people say I’ve never had a good game away from home. I have. It’s just probably the games in between have been poor rather than average. “It’s not something that gets me down. I know what I’m capable of. The fact I’ve been selected suggests I’m pretty good and from a knowledge perspective I have a wealth of it, more so now than ever in my career.

“The opinion inside this dressing room is the only one that counts, captain and coach. As long as you’re working towards the team trying to win and in the style they want, that’s all that matters. While I’ve got that backing and support from them, I will continue to give it everything for England, home, away, wherever.”

It is good to hear Woakes sounding so bullish, even if talk of Mr Nice Guy has always underplayed his inner steel. Pakistan is not necessarily the fast-medium graveyard some assume. Jimmy Anderson and Ollie Robinson got the Kookaburra ball to nip about in late 2022, their contributions central to the 3-0 clean sweep. This time Robinson is on the outer, not trusted to stay on the park after too many false dawns with conditioning, while Anderson has slotted into the role of bowling coach after McCullum tapped him on the shoulder in April.

When Woakes, 35, survived this look to the future it was queried by some, even if he is seven years Anderson’s junior and the batting made it a false equivalence. “Sometimes that’s taken for granted,” he says. “Part of the reason I have played so much is that role. You have to bat time, build partnerships, change gear.

“I’ve worked on it all my career and get serious job satisfaction from it. Although I look back at the 62 [in the third Test against West Indies] and think I threw it away. No Warwickshire player has scored a Test hundred at Edgbaston. I knew that stat and still kick myself.”

After a decade operating in the slipstream of Anderson and Stuart Broad, the upshot, finally, was a first summer with the new ball. That in itself says a bit more about the home and away records, not that Woakes has ever bemoaned coinciding with the pair. “I can’t say the new ball was overdue,” he says.

“I have so much to thank them for. If they’d not been around I might not have learned so much. I may have got an opportunity sooner but might not have been as good. We’ll never know. I’ve won 200-odd caps across all three formats and I’d have been happy with just one in each. I feel very fortunate, even if it’s taken a lot of hard work.”

That hard work often gets underplayed with fast bowlers and, as well as a dash of salt and pepper in the beard, this summer has brought a touch of the old bowler’s gait when Woakes is walking back to his mark; a slight hobble that denotes a career of pushing through the pain barrier.""",
